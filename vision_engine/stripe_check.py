"""
vision_engine/stripe_check.py
=============================
Checks the painted stripes on a cable with the second camera ("cam2").

Each part number has a group of painted bands round its cable, for example
three yellow stripes on a black cable. A check passes when the frame holds a
group of the expected number of stripes, in the expected colour, at the size
the good part showed when it was taught.

The part does not have to sit in a fixed place: the whole frame is searched,
and the cable may lie at any angle.

Methodology:
  - Teach: the operator boxes the stripe group on a good part. The stripes'
    colour, count, size and spacing are read from that box and saved per
    part number. The box only says which stripes to learn from.
  - Inspect: pixels of the expected colour anywhere in the frame are grouped
    into bands. Bands far from the taught stripe size, such as specks on the
    background or a mat of the same colour, are dropped. Bands lying close
    together form a group, and each group is counted along its own cable
    direction, so stripes that touch still count separately.
  - Result: OK if any group matches the taught count and group length.
